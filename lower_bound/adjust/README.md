Lower bound calculation
================

Obtaining vector of values P\_i (new distance matrix D\_i,j = C\_i,j + P\_i + P\_j
and also calculate an estimate for the lower bound (circles and paths)

1. make
2. ./adjust.cpp.bin

You may play with the number of iterations/step size as current numbers are rather generic
(I was manually updating stepsize all the time but I wanted to make it easy for others to run)
